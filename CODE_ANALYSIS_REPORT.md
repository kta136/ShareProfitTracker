# ShareProfitTracker — Code Analysis Report (Cleaned)

Analysis Date: 2025-09-13
Project Version: 1.0

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the current architecture, performance characteristics, and the improvements delivered so far. It replaces older exploratory notes, duplicated plans, and verbose code excerpts.

Status
- Phase 1: Complete — Controller separation laid out; unified pricing concept created.
- Phase 2: Complete — Unified price service integrated in UI, core DB flows made non-blocking, essential SQLite indexes added.
- Focus Next: Phase 3 (quality, tests, polish) and Phase 4 (nice-to-have features).

## Current Architecture Status

- UI Layer: `gui/main_window.py` now calls the unified price service. Portfolio load and refresh flows run heavy work off the Tk main thread and marshal UI updates back via `root.after(...)`.
- Service Layer: `services/unified_price_service.py` provides a single entry point with caching and circuit-breaker behavior. Legacy fetchers remain in the tree for reference only and can be removed once references in tests/docs are updated.
- Data Layer: `data/async_database.py` provides threaded async wrappers; core load and refresh paths use async methods to avoid blocking. Essential indexes created in `data/database.py` for common queries.

## Performance & Database

What’s implemented
- Indexes: stocks(user_id), stocks(user_id, symbol), price_cache(symbol), price_cache(last_updated), cash_transactions(user_id, transaction_date), other_expenses(user_id, expense_date), dividends(user_id, symbol).
- WAL and connection reuse in async DB manager for better concurrency.

Impact
- Faster portfolio loads and cache lookups, reduced CPU churn on repeated operations, smoother UI responsiveness during refreshes.

## Remaining Work (Phase 3+)

- Testing & Quality: Add unit/integration tests (target ~80% for core components); standardize lint/type checks.
- Cleanup: Remove legacy fetchers (`enhanced_price_fetcher.py`, `ultra_fast_price_fetcher.py`, `simple_fast_refresh.py`) after confirming no references in tests/docs; update docs accordingly.
- UX Polish: Improve progress indicators and user-facing error toasts for network/API failures.
- Configuration: Centralize settings; document environment-specific options.
- CI/CD: Add basic CI for tests and style to keep quality high.

## Conclusion

ShareProfitTracker moved from exploratory multi-fetcher logic and synchronous DB access to a unified pricing interface and non-blocking DB in core flows. With indexes in place, the app feels more responsive during typical usage. Next, we’ll focus on test coverage, small UX wins, and removing legacy code paths.
